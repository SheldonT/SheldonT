# 👋 Hi, I’m Sheldon

I’m a **software developer** with a background in **mechanical trades, water treatment, and marine systems**, now focused on building modern web applications with an emphasis on **real-time systems, data-driven interfaces, and collaborative tools**.

I’m a graduate of the **[Get Coding Software Development Program](https://www.getcoding.ca/)** in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador. While I started my career in hands-on technical fields, software development has always been my passion.
