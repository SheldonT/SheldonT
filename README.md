### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sheldon, and I'm currently a software development student with <a href="https://www.getcoding.ca/">Get-Coding</a>. I have just completed the React module of their program, and am currently working on a Ham Radio Logging app, <a href="https://github.com/SheldonT/Ham-Locator" target="_blank">Ham Locator</a>, and collaborating with a team to develop a website for a local company, <a href="https://cakeyhand.com/" target="_blank">Cakey Hand</a>.

I'm currently working as a Water Treatment Plant Operator, and I'm a certified Industrial Mechanic, and a former Marine Technician. I started in mechanical trades shortly after leaving highschool, but software development has always been a passion of mine. To this point, it's been a hobby, and I'm finally going to make it a career.
