### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sheldon, and I'm a software developer that went through the <a href="https://www.getcoding.ca/">Get-Coding</a> software development program in St. John's NL. Currently, I'm developing a digital audio workbench for [Songflow](songflow.io), which will be part of a larger application for collaborative music creation. Prior to that, I developed an application for managing customer orders for a local bakery, <a href="https://cakeyhand.com/" target="_blank">Cakey Hand</a>. My background is in water treatment, and I'm also a former Marine Technician. I started in mechanical trades shortly after leaving highschool, but software development has always been my passion.
